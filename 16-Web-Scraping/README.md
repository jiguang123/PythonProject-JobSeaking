# Web scraping with Python

### Overview:

A web scraper is a small computer program that accesses web pages, finds specified data elements on the page, 
extracts them (and transforms them if necessary), and compiles this data into a coherent data set.
A web scraper can be run iteratively over many web pages to collect data spread across thousands or millions of pages,
allowing you to construct large, robust data sets out of otherwise messy text that would only appear in your web browser.
Today we will learn about web scraping using Python's *scrapy* web scraping library.
