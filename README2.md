This repo is my workspace for developing a cycle of course materials, IPython notebooks, and tutorials towards an academic urban data science course based on Python.

Between Fall 2013 and Fall 2016, I was the grad student instructor (3 years) and co-lead instructor (1 year) for CP255, Urban Informatics and Visualization, at UC Berkeley. This course was developed by [Paul Waddell](https://ced.berkeley.edu/ced/faculty-staff/paul-waddell) and is ongoing at Berkeley with the fantastic contributions of [@Arezoo-bz](https://github.com/Arezoo-bz). If you're interested in these topics at all, you owe it to yourself to check out the latest iterations of Paul's excellent pedagogy in his [CP255 repo](https://github.com/waddell/urban-informatics-and-visualization). A couple years ago, I wrote this [blog post](http://geoffboeing.com/2015/08/urban-informatics-visualization-berkeley/) describing our efforts for the course.

Some of the course materials in *this* repo and their sequencing have been adapted from materials I previously developed for lectures I gave in CP255. Others I have developed for related topics in the years since.

These materials are licensed under the terms of the MIT license.
