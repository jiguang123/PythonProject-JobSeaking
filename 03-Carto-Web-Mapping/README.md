# Simple web mapping with CartoDB

### Overview:

Today we'll learn how to create simple (yet attractive and interactive) web maps with CartoDB to visualize spatial data on the web.
This will be a primarily self-directed study using the official CartoDB lessons.

### Readings:

CartoDB editor [overview](https://cartodb.com/editor/)

### Class Session:

1. Sign up for a [CartoDB](https://cartodb.com/) account
2. Go to the [CartoDB Academy](http://academy.cartodb.com/) and complete the "Online Mapping for Beginners" and the "Introduction to Map Design" courses
3. Review the CartoDB Wordpress embedding instructions PDF.

### Exercise:

1. The first step for this exercise will be to also complete the "Academy Lite" (5 minutes) and "Intermediate Map Design" (45 minutes) tutorials.
2. Next, find an interesting spatial data set (or multiple data sets) and upload them to CartoDB. Consider what questions or data interest you – what might you explore eventually as a final project for this course? This exercise could be a way to get started brainstorming. Ideally your data set(s) will be from any corner of the web – Google for ideas and data, search city web sites, or use a data set you’re already familiar with from another project. If all else fails, you can connect an existing CartoDB data source, like you do in the academy tutorials, but ideally you'd find something novel elsewhere.
3. Using your uploaded data set(s), create at least two maps with CartoDB. Adhere to the best practices you have learned from the Academy tutorials – including thoughtful use of colors, data, and labels.
4. Create a blog post on your Wordpress site, embed your interactive CartoDB maps in this blog post, and include a write-up discussing at a minimum the following elements:
   1. Where is the data from and how did you acquire it?
   2. What is the data about and why is it interesting?
   3. What stories do your maps tell?
   4. Who is your audience and how can they benefit from these visualizations?
   5. Why are these visualizations important or useful?
   6. Explain your process creating these maps with CartoDB: what did you do, what design decisions did you make, and why?
