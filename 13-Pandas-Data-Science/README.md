# Pandas data science

### Overview:

Pandas is an excellent tool to extend Python's capabilities into the data science world. Data science is an
interdisciplinary field about extracting knowledge from large volumes of data. It incorporates data cleaning,
data wrangling, statistics, visualization, machine learning, and computer programming. We've already explored
data cleaning, data wrangling, summary statistics, and visualization. Soon we'll look at regression modeling
and basic machine learning applications in Python. But today we'll dive in depth into subsetting and filtering 
data sets, working with time series, and mapping/applying functions to pandas data.

### Class Session:
