# Intro to Python

### Overview:

Today we'll introduce the basics of Python, a powerful programming language for data analysis, visualization, and simple application development. It's a great 
starter language because its syntax is simple and straightforward. We will use Anaconda to install Python onto our computers, and we will work with
Python via the Jupyter notebook. Jupyter notebooks let you use Python in an interactive coding environment that's easily packaged up and shared with others.

### Readings:

- Overview of the [Jupyter/IPython Notebook](https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/notebook/notebook.html)
- Chapters 2 and 3 of [Think Python](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/) (don't worry, the chapters are only like 8 pages long)
- *Optional*, if you're not familiar with the command prompt/terminal - read the ['basics' and 'folders' sections](http://dosprompt.info/), or [this guide](http://guides.macrumors.com/Terminal) if you're a Mac user
- *Optional*, short [overview of Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/static/img/Anaconda-Quickstart.pdf) if you're not already familiar with it

### Getting Started:

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) onto your computer.
2. Open a command prompt and change directory to this directory.
3. Run the command: jupyter notebook
4. A server window will open. Click the IPython notebook to launch it.
